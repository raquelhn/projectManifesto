# projectManifesto
In the CSS folder, a representation of a poster (the img is included in the folder) was done only using html and css
The ATM project was done using visual studio and C# and the main methods were define considering the business requirements send by the manifesto, as an example 
one bank account was instantiated and it could be seen that the methods worked properly, to test this the data can be introduce in the terminal.
